MongoDB like script engine binding to relational databases (using JSDB driver). Implementation provide `db` object
to access table and execute any queries.

Currently project contains two modules: jsdb-lib and jsdb-cli:

* jsdb-lib - JSDB library, provides binding between JSDC and script engine.
* jsdb-cli - command line interface for library.
